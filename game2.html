    <h1>Guess your age in hours!</h1>
    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
    <ol>
      <li>The game will ask you how old you are on the first prompt simply enter your age.</li>
      <li>After you enter your age you will have 20 chances to correctly guess how many hours you've lived.</li>
      <li>If your guess is too low the game will inform "Your guess is too low, you should live longer."</li>
      <li>If your guess is too high the game will inform you "You haven't lived that long yet."</li>
      <li>If you guess more than 20 times you lose!</li>
      <li>Once you enter your age correctly in hours you've won!</li>
    </ol>
